# GeO₂ Max

A web application that uses the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com) to visualize your Strava activities on a 3D globe.  I like to go up hills/mountains so it's nice to have something where I can see the terrain (if you tilt the camera).  

I've added miscellaneous features over the last few months to make finding your Strava activities easier, like sorting and searching.

Visit [geo2max.com](https://www.geo2max.com) to try it out!

Feel free to use anything here as a starting point for your own Strava application.
